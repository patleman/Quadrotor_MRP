# Quadrotor_MRP

A non linear disturbance observer and a non linear control law for the quadrotor dynamic system.(both for translational and rotational motion)


Objective:

1) Modelling quadrotor dynamic system :- Euler-lagrange equation
                                      :- Lagrangian equation
                                      :- Rotation matrix
                                      
2) 6-DOF Kinematics equations         :- Euler angles, Quaternions, Modified Rodrigues Parameters
                                      :- Conversion between them 
                                      :- the equation governing their rate of change
                                      :- rotation matrix formation from each kind of representation

3) State estimation of 6-dof          :- position and orientation
                                      :- implementing kalman filter 
                             
4) Non linear PID control augmented with NDO(Non linear disturbance observer)


5)Speech recognition based trajectory selector  :- Stft images of audio and then classifying them by implementing deep learning model.
